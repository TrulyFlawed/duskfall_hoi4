<!-- About the Project -->
## About The Project

Duskfall is a Hearts of Iron IV mod that I'm working on as an attempt to clear up my own mods list, but perhaps also provide players with some great features/fixes that they might want to see in Hearts of Iron. This will for the most part be an individual project, besides community suggestions, which I may use to find ideas for what to improve next. This mod may turn into an overhaul mod if I see reason to begin working on individual country content itself, but I'll need a team then, so if that ever happens feel free to contact me using the info found in <a href="#contact">Contact</a>

Of course, in all likelihood, the project reaching a point where it becomes a total overhaul mod is probably next to nothing, especially given my disappointingly often tendencies to stop working on a project when I get distracted or frustrated at it. But at least it gives me something to do, and at least I get to reduce the size of my mods folder.

## Project Roadmap

- [ ] Add features
- [ ] Fix Bugs

Yeah, that's it really. Not really surprising given that so far the project is not a total overhaul project yet, but it would probably be a pain to try and put all planned changes in one list, so take a look at [open issues](https://github.com/TrulyFlawed/duskfall_hoi4/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
